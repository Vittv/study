# Study Journey Documentation

Welcome to my study repository! Here, I chronicle my learning journey through various courses, lessons, and projects in the field of programming and web development.
>All courses below offer certification (aside from TOP)

## Courses Completed

### 1. [cursoemvideo - Python3](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/python-3-mundo-1/)
- **ETC:** 120 hours
- **Language:** Portuguese (PT)
- **Description:** This course taught me all the way from print('Hello World') to functions, modules, packages. But it did not cover classes or anything more. It was a total of 23 lessons and 115 exercises. You'd watch the lesson and be given around 5-10 exercises to finish before the next lesson. To finish the whole course, you had to not only do every exercise but watch their explanation after each lesson. So you always knew how to build what was asked for in the end, even if you had no idea at first.

### 2. [freecodecamp - Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)
- **ETC:** 50 hours
- **Language:** English (EN)
- **Description:** This one taught me HTML and CSS. It had quite a different approach compared to my Python course. Because this time, it was entirely project based. Every lesson was a project you built along instructions. You did a few project lessons, building small projects as you go, and then a final project for that module. It was a total of 15 lessons and 5 final projects. Finish 5 final projects and get your certification. I will say, this course was fun, it made developing feel more real. As in I could see what I was doing and how everything worked. In the end it left me with some nice projects. Nothing to be super proud of, but they look nice, making the experience very satisfying in the end.

## Courses Planned

### 3. [freecodecamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)
- **Language:** English (EN)
- **Description:** Will start upon completion of Responsive Web Design course.

### 4. [freecodecamp - Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
- **Language:** English (EN)
- **Description:** Will start upon completion of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

## Future Plans

Once I have completed the above courses, I plan to either:

- Enroll in [The Odin Project's Web Development Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths), which offers a comprehensive path to becoming a Full Stack Developer.
- Continue with additional courses on freecodecamp to further expand my skills before pursuing The Odin Project.
