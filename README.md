# Welcome to my Study!
Here, I document my learning journey.

Courses, Lessons, Projects

Predominantly in EN, sometimes PT

>All of these courses offer certification


# First course:

**cursoemvideo - Python3 (PT)**


This course taught me all the way from print('Hello World') to functions, modules, packets. But it did not cover classes or anything more.

It was a total of 23 lessons and 115 exercises. You'd watch the lesson and be given around 5-10 exercises to finish before the next lesson.

To finish the whole course, you had to not only do every exercise but watch their explanation after each lesson.

So you always knew how to build what was asked for in the end, even if you had no idea at first.


# Second course:

**freecodecamp - Responsive Web Design (EN)**


I am still working on this one. It's taught me HTML and CSS basics so far. It has quite a different approach compared to my Python course.

Because this time, it is entirely project based. Every lesson is a project you build along instructions. You do around 5 project lessons,

building small projects as you go, and then a final project for that module. Finish 5 final projets and you get your certification.


# Third Course:

**freecodecamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (EN)**


Will start on this one once I finish Responsive Web Design Certification.



# Fourth Course:

**freecodecamp - Front End Development Libraries (EN)**


Will start this one once I finish JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.


# Fifth Course:


At this point I will probably have enough information to build my own projects.

Either way I'd like to always keep studying. I plan to either do the entire

The Odin Project's Web Developent Course, which turns you in to a Full Stack Developer

or I'll do more freecodecamp courses before I do this one.
