          <ul>
            <li><strong>1815</strong> - Born in London</li>
            <li><strong>1816</strong> - When Ada was five weeks old, her mother left Lord Byron because of his incessant drinking and womanizing.</li>
            <li><strong>1819</strong> - Ada's mother wrote a poem called "The Unnatural Mother", describing her guilt, shame and resentment when looking at Ada. She couldn't help but think her daughter was an image of her troublesome marriage. As Lady Byron's health deteriorated, Ada was often left in care of her grandmother Judith. A governess was also assigned, teaching her, history, literature, languages, geography, music, sewing and mathematics, amongst other things. </li>
            <li><strong>1824</strong> - Aged 36, Lord Byron passes away far from home as a result of his partaking in the Greek War of Independence.</li>
            <li><strong>1828</strong> - At age 12, Ada writes her first book called "Flyology" where she examines the dynamics of flight.</li>
            <li><strong>1829</strong> - Ada was often sick and eventually suffered from a form of paralysis. By the time she was in her early teens, she could often be seen walking around on crutches.</li>
            <li><strong>1832</strong> - Once Ada recovered and got into music lessons and horse riding, she fell in love with her tutor. Her mother did not accept the relationship, making Ada run away to the home of her tutor and his parents. However, she was immediately returned to her mother's care.</li>
            <li><strong>1833</strong> - Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage, who would later be coonsidered a founding father fo the computer. He showed Ada his so-called Difference Engine, a machine that attempted to perform simple calculations. Which intrigued Ada, making her think of all the possibilities such machine might entail.</li>
            <li><strong>1835</strong> - At age 19, Ada marries William King.</li>
            <li><strong>1836</strong> - Ada and William have their first child, a son named Byron.</li>
            <li><strong>1837</strong> - Byron is joined by his newborn sister Anne. Who would later become the co-founder, together with her husband Wilfrid Blunt, of the famous Crabbet Arabian Stud.</li>
            <li><strong>1838</strong> - William King's appointment as the Earl of Lovelace resulted in Ada being named the Countess of Lovelace, a title that would later make her famous.</li>
            <li><strong>1839</strong> - Ada and Wililam have their third and final child, a boy named "Ralph Gordon".</li>
            <li><strong>1841</strong> - At age 25, Ada wasnted to get back into the scientific world. She was taked with translating a lecture performed by Charles Babbage into English. The lecture was about Babbage's new Analytical Engine, which was based on his previous work on the Difference Engine.</li>
            <li><strong>1843</strong> - Ada finishes her work on the translation of Babbage's Lecture as well as her detailed notes on the tpic, which ended up being much longer and more important than the translation itself. Her notes were categorized from A to G, the most famous of which was called Note G. Nowadays, the Analytical Engine is seen as an early model of a computer while Ada's notes describe, for the first time, a computer and its software. This work caused many to accredit Ada Lovelace with the pretigious title of the world's first computer programmer.</li>
            <li><strong>1844</strong> - Ada was often sick and bedridden, causing her doctor to prescribe her with a common medicine of the time called laudanum, which consisted oof a mix of alcohol and opium. Ada soon became addicted to this potent drug. During these troublesome years, she also took up a horse gambling habit.</li>
            <li><strong>1848</strong> - Ada's son Byron decides, at age 12, to set out on a journey to travel the world. He eventually sailed all the way to Tasmania, Chile, and California.</li>
            <li><strong>1850</strong> - With the help of Charles Babbage, Ada came up with a system that was meant to predict gambling odds on horse races. This failed, causing Ada to end up with huge debts. It is said Ada had pawned the family jewels twice to pay for her debts, during the last few years of her life.</li>
            <li><strong>1851</strong> - At age 35, Ada was diagnosed with uterine cancer.</li>
            <li><strong>1852</strong> - Passes at the age of 36.</li>
